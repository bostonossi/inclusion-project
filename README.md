## Open Source Software Diversity & Inclusion 

Boston University Open Source Software Initiative project seeking to contribute to CHAOSS' Augur. We would like to study how healthy are open source software communities on Github in terms of diversity and inclusion. We want to create special metrics and run them on projects of our choice through an additional Augur plugin and our own database.
